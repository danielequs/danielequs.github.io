## Listing of my pages on GitHub

I'll develop content for [this page](https://danielequs.github.io) over time ...

I'll also want to [clone this repository on my git client (GitHub Desktop) and create an index.html](https://pages.github.com) (or index.md?) file for it.

For now I'll just link to the pages of several folks I follow:
- [Roy Mendelssohn's Page](https://rmendels.github.io)
- [Eric Archer's Page](https://rmendels.github.io)
- [Michael Sumner's Page](http://mdsumner.github.io/)
- [Mathieu Basille's Page](https://mablab.org)
- [Maëlle Salmon's Page](https://masalmon.eu)
- [Jakub Nowosad's Page](https://nowosad.github.io)
- [Thomas Guillerme's Page](http://tguillerme.github.io)

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/danielequs/danielequs.github.io/edit/master/README.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/danielequs/danielequs.github.io/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
