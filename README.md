## Listing of my pages on GitHub

Over time I will develop content for [this user page](https://danielequs.github.io) as well as for dedicated project pages for my [GitHub repositories](https://github.com/danielequs).
Note to self 1: I will want to [clone this repository on my git client (GitHub Desktop) and create an index.html](https://pages.github.com) (or index.md?) file for it, or make it an RStudio project.

I may use this GitHub user page to complement my [profile page](https://mmi.oregonstate.edu/people/daniel-m-palacios) at Oregon State University's Marine Mammal Institute. I may also use it as a blog for our research lab, the [Whale Habitat, Ecology & Telemetry (WHET) Lab](https://mmi.oregonstate.edu/wtg).
Note to self 2: [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) with the [Mainroad theme](https://github.com/Vimux/Mainroad/) or [blogdown](https://github.com/rstudio/blogdown) in RStudio's R Markdown look like good choices, with free HTTPS hosting by [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com).


For now I'll just link to the pages of several folks I follow:
- [Olivier Gimenez's Page](https://oliviergimenez.github.io)
- [Rocio Joo's Page](https://rociojoo.github.io)
- [Roy Mendelssohn's Page](https://rmendels.github.io)
- [Eric Archer's Page](https://rmendels.github.io)
- [Michael Sumner's Page](http://mdsumner.github.io)
- [Mathieu Basille's Page](https://mablab.org)
- [Maëlle Salmon's Page](https://masalmon.eu)
- [Jakub Nowosad's Page](https://nowosad.github.io)
- [Thomas Guillerme's Page](http://tguillerme.github.io)

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/danielequs/danielequs.github.io/edit/master/README.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown
Syntax highlighted code block

# Header 1
## Header 2

**Bold** and _Italic_ and `Code` text

[Link](url) and ![Image](src)
```

For more details see [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/danielequs/danielequs.github.io/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
